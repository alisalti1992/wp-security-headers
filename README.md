# Move Ahead Media WordPress Security Headers
This is a WordPress plugin that is designed to add security headers to a website.

The plugin uses the header() function in PHP to send a series of HTTP headers to the browser that can help to improve the security of the website.

1- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block This header enables the browser's built-in XSS protection and will block any potential cross-site scripting attacks.

2- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff This header prevents the browser from trying to guess the MIME type of a file, which can help to prevent certain types of attacks.

3- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN This header tells the browser that the site can only be framed by pages that are from the same origin, which can help to prevent clickjacking attacks.

4- X-Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; This header sets a Content Security Policy for the site that controls where resources can be loaded from. It restrict loading resources only from the same origin.

5- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 This header tells the browser to always use HTTPS when connecting to the site, even when a user clicks on an HTTP link.

6- Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' sets a Content Security Policy for the site that controls where resources can be loaded from. It restrict loading resources only from the same origin.

7- Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade Tells the browser to not send the referrer header when the user navigates from HTTPS to HTTP.

Permissions-Policy : This header enable browser to indicate which APIs site is allowed to use (or not) and what features are available to the user.

The plugin also uses the add_action function to hook into the send_headers action. This means that the toptal_wordpress_security_headers() function will be executed whenever WordPress sends headers to the browser.

It is important to know that these headers are only effective if they are correctly configured, and they should be regularly monitored and reviewed as the best practices and technologies evolve.
